**Q.  What is Motor Insurance or Car Insurance**  
A.    Motor Insurance protects your Car, 2 wheeler or any vehicle from 2 kinds of risks:
One is the damage to the car, say an accident resulting in body repair or parts damage. This is referred to as Own Damage Cover.
The second part is called 3rd Party Cover and refers to any liability that you or your car may cause to another person. Say, your vehicle accidentally hit someone else’s house and broke the wall, the impacted person will expect you to pay up for repairing his wall.
The policies we sell have both these covered under a Comprehensive motor insurance policy.

**Q.  Are there different types of Car Insurance**  
A.    Most of the companies offer similar motor insurance policies as far as basic features go. Where companies differ is the service capabilities and claim and repair servicing networks. Some Companies also offer cashless claim servicing, through their tie-ups with authorized car garages. Other companies have strategic partnerships with specific Car Manufacturers which leads to better pricing for those car models if you take insurance from them.

**Q.  What are the factors one should look at while choosing the plan?**  
A.    One should look at the following factors:
Insured Declared Value of the vehicle or in simple language, the current value of your car. This is usually a fixed figure based on depreciation of your car and hence dependent on how old your car is. Some Insurance companies allow for minor change to the Insured Value usually upto 10 % higher or lower.
Cashless Coverage – For different Car models, Insurance companies offer Cashless Cover – which means you don’t need to pay the garage for repair and then claim re-imburement from the insurance company. The Insurance company can directly pay the garage for the said amount\*  
(_\* minus of Depreciation, unless you have Zero Depreciation Policy_)

More the number of garages near your vicinity, its better for you. Simple click here to get a list of Garages that offer cashless cover facility for each insurer.
Claim Settlement Record – You should also consider the claim settlement record for the insurer from whom you are planning to buy the insurance plan. While the data is available on [IRDA website](http://www.irda.gov.in). we also make the same data available on Renewbuy. Watch this space for more.

**Q.  How does Depreciation impact me?**  
A.    Depreciation impacts your Car Insurance plan in 2 ways.
Firstly, the car you drive keeps depreciating in value and therefore, your insurance cover is only for what is the current value of the vehicle. Say for instance, you bought a car for 20  lakhs about 2 years ago, the current value of the car would be probably 15 lakhs. Most companies have standard methods or formula to calculate this figure for most make/models of cars.
Secondly, at the time of claim, the insurance company deducts depreciation on parts that it replaces. This is very important to understand as you may have noticed earlier when you have had a car insurance claim, even with a comprehensive insurance policy, you need to pay part of the bill (while the rest is paid by the insurance company) This is typically the depreciation amount on parts that get replaced. Some parts like windshield have a 50% depreciation charge. However, if you buy a Zero Depreciation Plan, you do not have to pay anything and all this is covered as well by the insurance company.

**Q.  What are Zero Depreciation Plans?**
A.    Zero Depreciation Plans (or Zero Dep) are those plans that do not charge depreciation in the event of a claim. While normal motor insurance plans reimburse the repair cost in the event of a claim, they do not reimburse for the full value on the part. The reimbursement is to the extent of the depreciated value of the part. Parts like Windshield, Bumbers made of fiber, Tyres, etc have 50% depreciation on Day 1. eg. If the cost of replacement of your broken windshield is Rs. 20000, the insurer will only pay Rs. 10000 while the balance has to be borne by you. Do note that these depreciated parts are fairly expensive parts for vehicles costing more than 5 Lakhs. Thus it is always advisable that for vehicles which are costing more than 5 Lakhs, you should always consider buying a Zero Dep plan, even if they work out to be little more expensive. Do note that not all the insurers sell this product. Some also have restrictions which does not allow you to buy the product if your car is more than 3 yrs old in some cases and more than 5 yrs in some other cases.


**Q.  How is my Insurance premium determined?**  
A.    Many factors determine the premium you will pay. For Own Damage cover different insurance companies charge different premiums for similar coverage. It’s always important to compare and get quotes from different insurance companies.
The insurance premiums for own damage cover are usually dependent on following factors - Age of vehicle; Discounts for certain car models/ Geography/ Past claims experience are taken into account while calculating premium.
Third Party Liability Premium rates are fixed and laid out by IRDA, the government body.
In case your vehicle is not currently insured because you missed renewing it on time (happens often, not to worry) some companies want to inspect your vehicle and also charge more for the same.


**Q.  What is the period of the policy?**  
A.    A motor policy is valid for 1 year and has to be renewed before the due date. Pay the premium on time. No Insurer offers a grace period for paying the premium. In case of lapse of policy by even one day, the vehicle may have to be inspected. Moreover, if a comprehensive policy is allowed to lapse for more than 90 days, the accrued benefit of NCB (No Claim Bonus) is also lost.

**Q.  What is "No Claim Bonus"?**  
A.    No Claim Bonus (NCB) is the benefit accrued to an insured for not making any claims during the previous policy period.  As per current norms in India, it ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium (and not on 3rd party liability premium) and progressively increases to a maximum of 50%. If a claim is lodged, the entire No Claim Bonus (NCB) is lost in the subsequent policy period. NCB is given to the insured and not to the insured vehicle. Hence, on transfer of the vehicle, the insurance policy can be transferred to new owner but not the NCB. The new owner has to pay the difference on account of NCB for the balance policy period. The original owner can, however, use the NCB on a new vehicle purchased by him.

**Q.  Will my No Claim Bonus get migrated if I want to change my insurance company?**  
A.    Yes, your No Claims Bonus will be valid even if you change the insurance company on renewal. You would have to produce proof of the NCB earned by way of renewal notice from the current insurer. Alternately, you can produce your original, expiring policy along with a simple declaration that you have lodged no claims on the expiring policy.

**Q.  Are there other discounts that can reduce my premium?**  
A.    In addition to NCB, there are additional discounts available under Own Damage Premium for membership of Automobile Association of India, Vintage Cars (Pvt. Cars certified by the Vintage and Classic Car Club of India); Installation of anti-theft devices approved by Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune and whose installation is approved by AAI; Concessions for specially designed/modified vehicles for the Blind, Handicapped and mentally challenged persons, which are suitably endorsed in the RC by the RTA concerned; - opting for voluntary additional deductible/excess.

**Q.  Is Service Tax applicable and how much is it?**  
A.    Yes, Service Tax is applicable and would be as per prevailing rule of law. Currently the Service Tax Applicable is 12.36% on the total premium.

**Q.  What is Deductible or Excess?**  
A.    Deductible or “excess” is the minimum amount that you have to pay for every claim you make. There is a standard/compulsory excess for most vehicles ranging from Rs 50 for two-wheelers to Rs 500 for Private Cars and Commercial Vehicles which increases depending upon the cubic capacity/carrying capacity of the vehicle. However, in some cases the insurer may impose additional excess depending upon the age of the vehicle or if there is high frequency of claims.


**Q.  If I am using the car in a particular city, what premium rate is applied?**  
A.    For the purpose of applying premium rate, the place where the vehicle is registered is considered (not the place where the vehicle is used). For Eg, if your vehicle is registered in Chennai, the rate applicable for Chennai is charged. Even when you shift to a different city / town, the same rate will continue to be applied.

**Q.  What is a Certificate of Insurance under Motor Vehicle Act?**  
A.    As per Rule 141 of Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989, a certificate of Insurance is to be issued only in Form 51. It is only in Motor Vehicle Insurance, apart from the policy, that a separate certificate of insurance is required to be issued by insurers. This document should always be carried in the vehicle. The policy should be preserved separately at home / office.

**Q.  If I fit CNG or LPG kit in my vehicle, is it necessary to inform the Insurance Company?**    
A.    If a CNG / LPG kit is fitted in the vehicle, the (Road Transport Authority (RTA) office where the vehicle was registered should be informed so that they make a note of the change in the registration certificate (RC) of the vehicle. The insurance company should also be informed so that the kit is covered on payment of extra premium on the value of the kit under “OD” section and also under “LO” section.

**Q.  What are the documents to be kept in the vehicle while plying in public places?**

There is a nominal fee charged for transfer of insurance along with pro-rata recovery of NCB from the date of transfer till policy expiry. It may be noted that transfer of ownership in comprehensive/package policies has to be recorded within 14 days from date of transfer failing which no claim will be payable for own damage to the vehicle.

**Q.  Can I continue the insurance in the name of the previous owner even after the vehicle is transferred in RTO records in my name?**
